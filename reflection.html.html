<b> In this ICT class, learning about HTML and website development was a challenging, but fun experience. Before, I interacted with websites as a user, but now, I understand how web pages are created from the ground up using HTML. </b> <br> <br>

<b> Working with HTML taught me how simple code can become a functional website. The hands-on activities helped me develop practical skills, which gave me a new perspective on how websites are made. I learned how to use basic tags to format content, create hyperlinks, embed media, and develop a simple webpage. </b> <br> <br>

<b> Overall, this class has given me a solid foundation in web development, and I am excited to explore HTML and other web technologies further. </b>
